The csvs are mostly gathered data used to train models

The models are different kind of models that have been trained to make these predictions - for now we are using the probabilstic model as it allows us to not just predict whether a page will make the front page or not but also the likelyhood that it will make the front page as a %.

The python code is all the code that gathers data, trains a model, tests it and uses it.
